                <p>Christ is central to my life. The way I think about issues and the decisions I make are heavily influenced by the teachings in the Bible. I desire for my life to bring all the glory to God.</p>

                <p>I was married June 7, 2014 to an amazing man, Josh. We met our first semester freshman year and started dating near the end of our sophomore year in college.</p>

                <h4><strong>I am a freelance software developer.</strong></h4>
                <p>Since Josh's job keeps us moving I started freelancing instead of trying to find a new job every six months! I enjoy the challenge that freelancing gives and freedom to choose the kind of projects I wish to be working on.</p>

            	<h4><strong>I love to travel as often as possible.</strong></h4>
                <p>I grew up in Virginia. I was homeschooled my entire life, which I think contributed to my love of travel. Since my family and I were not tied down to a school schedule we were able to travel more frequently than most of my friends growing up. Over the years I just got accustomed to seeing new things on a fairly regular basis. Thankfully, Josh is good about traveling with me.</p>
