<p>To introduce myself, I am a recent college graduate. I graduated May 2014 from Liberty University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.</p>

<p>I am recently married! I was married June 7, 2014 to an amazing man, Josh. We met our first semester freshman year and started dating near the end of our sophomore year in college.</p>

<p>I am a freelance software developer. Since Josh's job keeps us moving I started freelancing instead of trying to find a new job every six months! I enjoy the challenge that freelancing gives and freedom to choose the kind of projects I wish to be working on.</p>

<p>I am a Christian. Christ is central to my life. The way I think about issues and the decisions I make are heavily influenced by the teachings in the Bible. I desire for my life to bring all the glory to God.</p>

<p>I grew up in Virginia. I was homeschooled my entire life, which I think contributed to my love of travel. Since my family and I were not tied down to a school schedule we were able to travel more frequently than most of my friends growing up. Over the years I just got accustomed to seeing new things on a fairly regular basis. Thankfully, Josh is good about traveling with me.</p>
